- kind of a pain to get a 'modern' version of python on OSX
- also kind of a pain to cast everyting to the same type to get things to play nice
	ex. for i in range(1,9):
			print(str(i) + ' times 2 is ' + str(i * 2))
- I'm sure a lot of what I'm bitching about is coming from 'omg it's different than what I'm used to omg' or because of the fact that my exposure of dynamically typed languages so far has been ruby, elixir, and js, and now I have some expectation of what dynamically typed languages 'should' be.

-Having to indent statements (even in the repl!) is a pain in the buns

- There are 'falsy' values like 0

-Things that are 'omg different'
	-True and False are your boolean values (note the capitalization)

-Mutable types (lists) and immutable types (strings & tuples)

-Lists, tuples, dictionaries
-pprint() is great for printing lists and such

May 5
- triple quote ''' for printing multiline strings
	-kinda like """ in elixir for doc strings
-I like python's approach to multiline comments over ruby, I think. Enclosing a multiline comment in triple double quotes is less weird than the =begin and =end

May 6
- python packages are awesome
	- pprint, re (for regex), os (for file operations), unittest
-file utilities are cool

May 8
	-learning about unittest
	-test.py -v for verbosity
	-learned ways of importing modules into other files
		import test
		test.Person()

		Or

		from test import Person
		Person()
	-Have a passing unit test set up for my sudoku solver :)

May 13
	-has multiple inheritance (mixins) like ruby
	-doesn't seem to have concept of interfaces or abstract classes
