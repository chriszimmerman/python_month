- kind of a pain to get a 'modern' version of python on OSX
- also kind of a pain to cast everyting to the same type to get things to play nice
	ex. for i in range(1,9):
			print(str(i) + ' times 2 is ' + str(i * 2))
- I'm sure a lot of what I'm bitching about is coming from 'omg it's different than what I'm used to omg' or because of the fact that my exposure of dynamically typed languages so far has been ruby, elixir, and js, and now I have some expectation of what dynamically typed languages 'should' be.

-Having to indent statements (even in the repl!) is a pain in the buns

- There are 'falsy' values like 0

-Things that are 'omg different'
	-True and False are your boolean values (note the capitalization)

-Mutable types (lists) and immutable types (strings & tuples)

-Lists, tuples, dictionaries
-pprint() is great for printing lists and such
